Running on local Linux machine

### Downloading datasets

```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz
gunzip green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv
```

### Building data ingestion container

see Dockerfile and ingest_data.py
(note: I copied verbatim the construction with while True and catching StopIteration because it's a few hours before the deadline and I don't have time to write my own code)
```bash
docker build -t taxi_ingest:v003 .  # there were previous attempts
```

### Docker for Postgres

With pgadmin and the data ingestion container

Note: I'm only running the last container interactive and others detached

```bash
docker network create pg-network
docker run -d \
  -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
  -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
  -v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  --network=pg-network \
  --name pg-database \
  postgres:13

docker run -d \
  -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL="admin@admin.com" \
  -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="root" \
  -p 8080:80 \
  --network=pg-network \
  --name pgadmin-2 \
  dpage/pgadmin4

docker run --rm -it \
  --network=pg-network \
  taxi_ingest:v003 \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=pg-database \
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=green_taxi_trips \
    --url=${URL}

```


## Homework

### Question 1. Knowing docker tags

Which tag has the following text? - Automatically remove the container when it exits

--rm

### Question 2. Understanding docker first run

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash. Now check the python modules that are installed ( use pip list ). What is version of the package wheel ?

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash python:3.9
pip list  # 0.42.0
docker ps -a
docker rm 8812164e3a17
```

### Question 3. Count records

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?   - 15612

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(1)
FROM green_taxi_trips
WHERE CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-18' AND CAST(lpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-18'
;
```

### Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Use the pick up time for your calculations.

```sql
SELECT
    MAX(trip_distance) AS dist, lpep_pickup_datetime
FROM green_taxi_trips
GROUP BY lpep_pickup_datetime
ORDER BY dist DESC
LIMIT 1
;
```

341.64 on "2019-09-26 19:32:52"

### Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs

Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown. Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?

```sql
SELECT zones."Borough"
FROM green_taxi_trips AS trips JOIN zones ON trips."PULocationID" = zones."LocationID"
WHERE CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-18'
GROUP BY zones."Borough"
HAVING SUM(trips.total_amount) > 50000
;
```

Brooklyn Manhattan Queens

### Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? We want the name of the zone, not the id.

```sql

SELECT zones."Zone", trips.tip_amount
FROM zones LEFT JOIN green_taxi_trips AS trips ON trips."DOLocationID" = zones."LocationID"
WHERE trips."PULocationID" IN (SELECT "LocationID" FROM zones WHERE "Zone" = 'Astoria')
ORDER BY trips.tip_amount DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
